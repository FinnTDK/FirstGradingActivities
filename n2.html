I can't fight this feeling any longer<br>
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow<br>
What started out as friendship has grown stronger<br>
I only wish I had the strength to let it show<br>
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever</i></font></center><br>

&nbsp;
      <left><u><font face="Tahoma" size="3" color="red">
I said there is no reason for my fear<br>
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together<br>
You give my life direction, you make everthing so clear<br>
And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight<br>
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night</u></font></center><br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      <center><b><i><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="green">
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might<br>
And I can't fight this feeling anymore<br>
I've forgotten what I started fighting for<br>
It's time to bring this ship into the shore<br>
And throw away the oars, forever</i></b></font></center><br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      <p style="text-align:right;"><b><i><font face="Harrington" size="5" color="orange">
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore<br>
I've forgotten what I started fighting for<br>
And if I have to crawl upon the floor, come crashing through your door<br>
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore<br>
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you</i></b></font></p><br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      <p style="text-align:center;"><b><i><font face="Forte" size="4" color="yellow">
I've been running 'round in circles in my mind<br>
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl<br>
'Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find<br>
And even as I wander, I'm keeping you sight<br>
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night</i></b></font></p><br>
