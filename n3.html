      <h2><center>Favorite Dish: Fried Chicken</center></h2><br>
      <img src="assets/fried_chicken.jpg"><br>
      <b><font face="Tahoma">Ingredients</b></font><br>
       <ul><font face="verdana">
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
       </font></ul><br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
        <dl><font face="verdana">
         <dt>Step One</dt>
         <dd>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.<br>
             Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use).<br> 
             Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).<br></dd>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
         <dt>Step Two</dt>
         <dd>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.<br>
             Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper.<br>
             LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!<br></dd>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
         <dt>Step Three</dt>
         <dd>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil.<br>
             Heat until VERY hot. Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold.<br>
             Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides. When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy).<br>
             Remove cover, raise heat again and continue to fry until crispy.<br></dd>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
         <dt>Step Four</dt>
         <dd>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels.<br>
             Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts.<br>
             Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.<br></dd>
