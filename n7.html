     <left>In our present view, the resolution of this divergence between our students and our educational practice lies in drastic educational reform, reform that will bring the classroom into line with society.<br>
The immediate task of education is to embrace the future  and  empower  our  children to learn with the cultural  tools  they  have  already been given.<br> 
The government  has indeed  increased  the  accessibility in information technology,  according  to  the department of education (2003, 2007b) below is the percentage of information technology access by region (dark = with access; light = without access):<br>
Among secondary schools with computers (15% of the total number of secondary schools),
only 56% of the teachers uses computers in teaching, the rest use computers for office work.<br> 
Within them only 19% has access to internet.<br>
Generally,  among  the  secondary  students,  92.1%  were  reported  to  be  using computers  for  learning (DepEd, 2007b).<br>
Policies on the use of information technology in Philippine education (DepEd, 2003):<br>
1. Technology shall be studied first as a separate subject and then applied in other learning areas as a tool for learning how to learn.<br> 
2. An education modernization program shall  be undertaken to equip schools with facilities,  equipment, materials and skills and  to  introduce new learning/delivery  systems  necessary to capitalize on recent technological developments.<br> 
3. The  participation  of  other  stakeholders  in  education  shall  be  generated  in  the  upgrading  and modernization of the public schools especially those in the underserved provinces.</left><br>
